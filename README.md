# Research Paper Notes

Research Papers/Manuscripts are amazing pieces of art reflecting efforts done by an individual or a group over a period of time. Stuff they've pondered over for hours, scratching their heads up, scribbling pencil over papers, what worked & what didn't- it's all condensed into these couple of pages. Reading Research Papers is what I love spending my time over when I'm not in front of the computer screen. This repository contains research papers that I've read over mapped with their Summaries/ Short notes.
